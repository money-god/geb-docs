# Governance

The TAI governance contracts are based on the OpenZeppelin governor, that itself was based on the now classic Compound Governor Bravo. This is the governance used by most protocols and should be familiar to anyone that has participated in the governance of the largest protocols, such as Uniswap, ENS and Compound.
