# Goverance Process

#### 1. Forum Discussion

The proposer creates a thread on the[ governance forum](https://gov.tai.money), describing the proposal in detail. Here the goal of the proposal is outlined, as well as the benefits and risks to TAI. The thread on the forum should exist for a period long enough to allow discussion, feedback and refinement by the community.

#### 2. Post Proposal and Voting Delay

Proposal is posted on [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/tai). To prevent proposal spam, a **proposal threshold** of 500 RATE is needed by the address posting the proposal. When the proposal is posted, a **voting delay** of 2 days starts. During this period, voters can transfer RATE or TAI and delegate their voting power to prepare for voting.

#### 3. Voting Period

After the voting delay, a snapshot is taken and further delegations and transfers will have no effect on voting power for this proposal. This snapshot marks the beginning of the **voting period**, which lasts for 5 days.&#x20;

During the voting period, RATE holders can vote for/against or abstain for this proposal.  TAI holders can vote to veto by delegating their TAI to the proposal address.

#### 3. Proposal is Queued

After the voting period ends, a proposal can then be queued for execution if:

It has reached the **quorum,** 3% of RATE circulating supply, _and_ it has a majority of support votes.

#### 4. Proposal Veto Period

After the voting period ends, TAI holders can execute a veto if 25% of the TAI supply voted to veto.

The veto must be executed within the veto period, which is currently set to 12 hours.

#### 5. Proposal Executed

After the veto period has passed, anyone can execute the proposal.
