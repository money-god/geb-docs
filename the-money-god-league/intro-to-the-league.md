# Intro to The League

## 1. Overview

The Money God League is an initiative meant to bring non-pegged stable assets \(stablecoins\) into the mainstream. The League is also devoted toward making control theory a common framework used in a wide variety of DeFi related projects.

## 2. Who Can Be in The League?

Initially, the TAI team will seek to work with a few established projects that have a clear idea of what they want to achieve with their stable assets and also have a roadmap with collateral assets that they want to add in the new protocols.

## 3. Entering the League

For now, you can simply join [TAI's Discord](https://discord.com/invite/qd7MZwjF2u) and start to talk with the core team about building a new Money God. More details will be released in the next few months.
