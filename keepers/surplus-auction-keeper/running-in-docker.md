# Running in Docker

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to participate in surplus auctions you need to bid with protocol tokens
{% endhint %}

## 1. Modify the model file as needed

A basic surplus auction bidding model can be found in `models/surplus_model.py`. This model retrieves the latest RATE/USD price from Coingecko and will automatically place bids in an auction.

You probably want to modify the following variables in `models/surplus_model.py`:

* `STARTING_RATE_MULTIPLIER`: the maximum acceptable RATE price to use when bidding. This value will be used when bidding on a new auction with no previous bids. Default: `1.50` meaning the maximum price to accept for RATE (in TAI terms) is 150% of the current RATE/USD market price
* `MINIMUM_RATE_MULTIPLIER`: the minimum acceptable RATE price to use when bidding. Default: `1.10` meaning the minimum price to accept for RATE (in TAI terms) is 110% of the current RATE/USD market price

`MY_BID_INCREASE`: The amount of bid increase(in RATE) to make when outbidding another bidder. If value is less than the auction house' `bidIncrease`, then it will use the auction house setting. Example: A value of `1.10` will create bid increases of 10%. Note: Current `bidIncrease` on mainnet is `1.03`. Default: `1.03`

Then, use `chmod +x surplus_model.py`.

For more information about bidding models, see [Bidding Models](../BiddingModels.md).

## 2. Modify the keeper run file

Modify the following variables in `run_surplus_keeper.sh`:

* `KEEPER_ADDRESS` - the keeper's address. It should be in checksummed format (not lowercase)
* `ETH_RPC_URL` - the URL of your Ethereum RPC connection
* `KEYSTORE_DIR` - the full path of the directory where your keystore file is
* `MODEL_DIR` - the full path of directory where your `surplus_model.py` file is
* `KEYSTORE_FILE` - your Ethereum UTC JSON keystore filename
* `GAS_MAXIMUM` -maximum gas price, in GWEI

For more information about the keystore format and how to generate it:

* [Ethereum UTC / JSON Wallet Encryption](https://wizardforcel.gitbooks.io/practical-cryptography-for-developers-book/content/symmetric-key-ciphers/ethereum-wallet-encryption.html)
* [keythereum](https://github.com/ethereumjs/keythereum)

Finally, to run the keeper, use `chmod +x run_surplus_keeper.sh`.

## 3. Start the keeper and enter your keystore file password

`./run_surplus_keeper.sh`

```
